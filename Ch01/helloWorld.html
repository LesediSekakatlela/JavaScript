    Hello world!

<-- When you run console.log("hello world"), it prints "hello world" to the console as you expect. 
However, the console.log() function itself doesn't give back any specific value after it's done printing. 
In JavaScript, when a function doesn't explicitly say what it returns, it automatically returns something called undefined,
 which basically means "no value". So, after printing "hello world", it also shows undefined, just to say, 
"Hey, nothing special was returned by the console.log() function." -->
