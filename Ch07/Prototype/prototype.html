<!-- Think of a prototype in JavaScript like a blueprint for creating objects.
 When you make an object without specifying anything special, it automatically takes on the basic blueprint called Object.prototype. 
 This blueprint provides the basic features all objects need. You don't need to know how it's made; just know it's there as a foundation. -->
