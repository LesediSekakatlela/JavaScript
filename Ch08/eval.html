<!-- Line 7 creates an input field. The onchange attribute specifies that when the content of this input field changes,
the go() function should be called, passing this as an argument.

Line 9 defines a function named go(). It takes one parameter e, which will represent the input element that triggered the change event.

Line 10 This line uses the eval() function to execute the JavaScript code that is entered into the input field. 
e.value retrieves the value of the input field (the JavaScript code entered by the user), and eval() executes it as JavaScript code.
