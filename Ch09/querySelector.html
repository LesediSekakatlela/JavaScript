    //Code 1
const ele1 = document.querySelector("h1");
console.dir(ele1);

The JavaScript code selects the first <h1> element in the document using the document.querySelector() method.
console.dir() is a method in JavaScript that displays an interactive list of the properties of a specified JavaScript object.
This method is particularly useful for exploring the structure of complex objects like DOM elements. 
It allows you to see the properties and methods available on an object in a structured and interactive way, 
making it easier to understand its structure and contents.


//Code 2
const eles = document.querySelectorAll(".output");
console.log(eles);

h1.output indicates the CSS selector used to select the <h1> element
the CSS selector .output is used. The dot (.) indicates that it's selecting elements with a specific class, and "output" is the class name.
This method returns a NodeList, which is a collection of all elements that match the specified selector.
