<!--  console.dir(document.body.children.forest.children.tree2.children.shrubbery.children.treasure);
console.dir: This is a method in JavaScript that displays an interactive list of the properties
document.body.children: This accesses the direct child nodes of the <body> element in the HTML document.
.forest: This accesses the element with the id "forest" among the children of the <body> element.
.children.tree2: This accesses the child element with the id "tree2" among the children of the element with the id "forest".
.children.shrubbery: This accesses the child element with the id "shrubbery" among the children of the element with the id "tree2".
.children.treasure: This accesses the child element with the id "treasure" among the children of the element with the id "shrubbery".

 <!-- console.dir(document.body.childNodes[3].childNodes[3].childNodes[1].childNodes[1]);
In JavaScript, the childNodes property returns a collection of child nodes of the specified parent node. Each child node can include elements, text nodes, comments.
When you access childNodes[3], you're retrieving the fourth child node of the parent node. So it's referencing the fourth child node of the <body> element.
childNodes[3].childNodes[3]: accesses the fourth child node of the previously accessed node, which is the fourth child node of the <body> element.
It also  refers to a nested child node within the <body> element.

.childNodes[1]: This accesses the second child node of the previously accessed node.
childNodes[1].childNodes[1] refers to a nested child node within the previously accessed node.
