<!--
([a-zA-Z0-9._-]+@): This part matches the local part of the email address before the '@' symbol. 
It allows one or more characters from the set of lowercase letters (a-z), uppercase letters (A-Z), digits (0-9), and special characters (_, ., -).

([a-zA-Z0-9._-]+\.): This part matches the domain part of the email address after the '@' symbol and before the '.'. 
It follows the same pattern as the local part.

([a-zA-Z0-9._-]+): This part matches the top-level domain part of the email address after the '.'. 
It also follows the same pattern as the local part.

"maaike_1234@email.com": This email address matches the pattern defined by emailPattern, so it appears in the output as expected.

"maaike@mail@.com": This email address doesn't match the pattern because it contains multiple '@' symbols and a trailing dot,
which violates the expected structure. Therefore, it doesn't appear in the output, resulting in null.
