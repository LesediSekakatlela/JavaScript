<!--
it will output an array of strings containing all sequences of four consecutive alphanumeric characters found in the string "I love JavaScript!".
in other words it is outputting a word that has four letters.

it will search for occurrences of 'ng' or just 'g' (since 'n' is optional) in the string "You are doing great!" 
in a case-insensitive manner. It will output an array containing all such matches.

it will search for sequences of "abc" that occur between 1 and 2 times consecutively in the string "abcabcabc". 
Since the whole string "abcabcabc" contains such a sequence ("abc" repeated three times), the output will be an array containing
the matched sequence "abcabc".
